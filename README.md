# Camel Learning

A machine learning library written in OCaml with no external
dependencies. See `examples/` directory for usage.

This project is made purely for educational purposes and is not
suitable for use in performance demanding applications.

## Algorithms

Currently the two supported methods of learning are:

  - using [finite differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference),
  - using [back propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation).
