# Camel Learning

A machine learning library written in OCaml with no external
dependencies. See `examples/` directory for usage.

## Work In Progress

There is a working example of an OR gate model in
`examples/or_gate.ml`. Currently the only method of learning for this
model is using finite differences, but the goal is to implement a
proper back propagation algorithm.
